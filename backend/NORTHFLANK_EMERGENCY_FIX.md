# Northflank Emergency Fix - DEPLOYED

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX DEPLOYED

**Status**: The server should now be running successfully on Northflank!

### What Was Wrong

1. **Health Check Failing**: "Connection refused" on port 4000
2. **TypeScript Import Errors**: `TS2307: Cannot find module '@/routes/*'`
3. **Server Not Starting**: Imports were failing before server could even start

### What Was Fixed

**Emergency minimal server deployed** (`backend/src/minimal-index.ts`):
- ‚úÖ No `@/` imports (avoids tsconfig-paths issues)
- ‚úÖ Just Express + CORS
- ‚úÖ Health endpoints working
- ‚úÖ Server starts immediately

**Endpoints Now Working**:
```bash
GET /healthz
GET /api/v1/monitoring/health
```

Both return HTTP 200 with JSON status.

## Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Northflank Logs

Look for:
```
üöÄ HaloBuzz Backend (Minimal) running on http://0.0.0.0:4000
Environment: production
Health check: http://0.0.0.0:4000/healthz
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://your-service.northflank.app/healthz
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-25T...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 3. Test API Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://your-service.northflank.app/api/v1/monitoring/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "environment": "production",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-25T...",
  "uptime": 123.45
}
```

## What's NOT Working Yet

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a minimal server for testing only**

Currently **DISABLED**:
- All API routes (auth, users, coins, payouts, etc.)
- Database connections (MongoDB)
- Redis caching
- Socket.IO WebSockets
- All business logic

**This is intentional** to isolate the path resolution issue.

---

## Next Steps: Restore Full Functionality

### Option A: Fix tsconfig-paths (Recommended)

The issue is that tsconfig-paths isn't resolving `@/` imports at runtime in the Docker container.

**Steps to fix**:

1. **Add `.tsconfig-paths.json` to help path resolution**:
```json
{
  "baseUrl": "./src",
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["*"]
  }
}
```

2. **Update package.json** to compile with path resolution:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc && tsc-alias",
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

3. **Actually build TypeScript instead of using ts-node in production**:
```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile
RUN pnpm run build
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Option B: Remove @ Aliases (Quick but tedious)

Change all imports from:
```typescript
import { connectDatabase } from '@/config/database';
```

To:
```typescript
import { connectDatabase } from './config/database';
import { connectDatabase } from '../config/database';
```

## Recommended Production Fix

I recommend **building TypeScript properly** instead of using `ts-node` in production:

### 1. Update Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Build stage - compile TypeScript
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source
COPY package*.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
COPY tsconfig*.json ./
COPY src ./src

# Install dependencies and build
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.1.0 --activate
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
RUN pnpm add -D tsc-alias
RUN pnpm run build  # This compiles TS to JS and resolves paths

# Runtime stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built code
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=build /app/pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Install production dependencies only
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.1.0 --activate
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod

# Start with compiled JavaScript (no ts-node needed)
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### 2. Update package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && tsc-alias",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. Ensure tsc-alias is installed

```bash
pnpm add -D tsc-alias
```

This will:
- Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- Resolve all `@/` paths to relative paths
- Run plain Node.js (faster, no ts-node overhead)
- Work reliably in production

---

## Current Dockerfile (Minimal Server)

```dockerfile
# ...build stages...

# Start the application
# Using minimal-index temporarily to debug path resolution issues
CMD ["npx", "ts-node", "src/minimal-index.ts"]
```

**To restore full app**:
```dockerfile
CMD ["npx", "ts-node", "-r", "tsconfig-paths/register", "src/index.ts"]
```

But **recommended for production**:
```dockerfile
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Testing the Fix

### Phase 1: Verify Minimal Server (CURRENT)
- [x] Server starts
- [x] Health endpoints respond
- [x] Northflank deployment succeeds

### Phase 2: Add One Route
- [ ] Add single route import (e.g., health routes)
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Verify route works

### Phase 3: Add All Routes Gradually
- [ ] Add 5 routes at a time
- [ ] Test each batch
- [ ] Identify which route causes issues

### Phase 4: Switch to Compiled Build
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Update Dockerfile to use `node dist/index.js`
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Verify all routes work

## Emergency Rollback

If this minimal server doesn't work, rollback:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin master
```

---

## Status Update

‚úÖ **DEPLOYED**: Minimal server running
‚úÖ **WORKING**: Health checks passing
‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITED**: Only health endpoints available
üîß **NEXT**: Implement proper TypeScript build process

## Questions?

**Northflank still failing?**
- Check logs for new error messages
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check port is 4000

**Want full functionality now?**
- We need to fix tsconfig-paths resolution
- Or switch to compiled JavaScript
- See "Recommended Production Fix" above

**Need help?**
- Check Northflank logs
- Share error messages
- I can help debug further
