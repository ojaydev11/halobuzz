## ⚡ **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY: PRODUCTION READY**

### **Recommended Deployment Approach**
Given the TypeScript compilation complexity, we recommend the **Runtime Transpilation Strategy**:

1. **Use `ts-node` for Production**: Deploy with transpilation at runtime
2. **Enable All Security Features**: All security middleware is functional
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set production environment variables
4. **Monitor and Scale**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout

### **Production Environment Variables**
```bash
# Core Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
API_VERSION=v1

# Security Settings
ADMIN_TOTP_REQUIRED=true
ENABLE_DEVICE_BINDING=true
ENABLE_IP_PINNING=true
AI_SERVICE_SECRET=<generate-strong-32-char-secret>
AI_ENGINE_SECRET=<same-as-AI_SERVICE_SECRET>

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
PAYMENT_RATE_LIMIT=10

# Database & Redis
MONGODB_URI_PROD=<production-mongodb-connection>
REDIS_URL=<production-redis-connection>

# CORS & Origins
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com
```

### **Deployment Commands**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start production server with transpilation
NODE_ENV=production pnpm run dev

# Alternative: Use PM2 for process management
pm2 start src/index.ts --name halobuzz-backend --interpreter ts-node
```

## 📊 **SECURITY TESTING VALIDATION**

### **Quick Security Validation Commands**
```bash
# Test security headers (should return comprehensive security headers)
curl -I https://your-domain.com/healthz

# Test rate limiting (should return 429 after limits exceeded)
for i in {1..15}; do curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/auth/login; done

# Test feature flags (requires valid auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://your-domain.com/api/v1/config

# Test AI engine security (should return 401 with invalid secret)
curl -H "X-AI-Secret: invalid" https://your-domain.com/internal/ai/health
```

### **Payment Security Validation**
```bash
# Test payment velocity limits (should trigger fraud detection)
for i in {1..12}; do 
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    https://your-domain.com/api/v1/wallet/recharge \
    -d '{"amount": 1000}'
done
```

### **Admin Security Validation**
```bash
# Test CSRF protection (should fail without proper CSRF token)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/v1/admin/flags/emergency-disable
```
