git commit -m "ðŸ”§ Fix TypeScript compilation errors for Northflank deployment

âœ… Fixed missing dependencies (ws, fastify, @nestjs, @types/webrtc)
âœ… Created missing modules (performanceMonitor, ShortVideo, AnalyticsEvent, RedisService)
âœ… Fixed export/import issues (Logger, middleware exports)
âœ… Fixed type errors (Jest matchers, Redis calls, property access)
âœ… Enhanced RedisService with missing methods
âœ… Fixed Redis hset method calls

This resolves the Docker build failures and enables successful deployment to Northflank."
