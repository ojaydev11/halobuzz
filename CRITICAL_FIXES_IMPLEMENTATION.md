## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Payment Gateway Integration
```typescript
// Example: eSewa Payment Creation
async createEsewaPayment(amount: number, userId: string, coins: number): Promise<any> {
  const esewaConfig = {
    baseUrl: process.env.ESEWA_BASE_URL || 'https://uat.esewa.com.np',
    merchantId: process.env.ESEWA_MERCHANT_ID || '',
    secretKey: process.env.ESEWA_SECRET_KEY || ''
  };

  const pid = `halobuzz_${userId}_${Date.now()}`;
  const paymentUrl = `${esewaConfig.baseUrl}/epay/main?pid=${pid}&amt=${amount}...`;
  
  return { success: true, paymentUrl, pid, amount, coins };
}
```

### AI Moderation System
```typescript
// Example: Content Moderation
async moderateContent(content: string | Buffer, type: 'text' | 'image' | 'video', userId: string): Promise<ModerationResult> {
  const result = await this.moderateText(content as string, userId);
  
  return {
    isSafe: result.confidence < this.moderationThresholds.nsfw,
    confidence: result.confidence,
    categories: result.categories,
    action: result.action
  };
}
```

### HaloAI Assistant
