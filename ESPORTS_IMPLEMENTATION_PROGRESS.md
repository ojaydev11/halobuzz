## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### Backend Route Registration

Add to `/backend/src/app.ts` or main router:

```typescript
import gamesEsportsRoutes from '@/routes/games-esports';
import mmrRoutes from '@/routes/mmr';
import matchmakingRoutes from '@/routes/matchmaking'; // To be created

app.use('/api/v1/games-esports', gamesEsportsRoutes);
app.use('/api/v1/mmr', mmrRoutes);
app.use('/api/v1/matchmaking', matchmakingRoutes);
```

### Mobile API Client

Create `/apps/halobuzz-mobile/src/services/GamesAPI.ts`:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const API_BASE = 'https://p01--halo-api--6jbmvhzxwv4y.code.run/api/v1';

export const gamesAPI = {
  startSession: (gameId, entryFee, mode) =>
    axios.post(`${API_BASE}/games-esports/session/start`, { gameId, entryFee, mode }),

  endSession: (sessionId, score, metadata, fpsMetrics, actionLog) =>
    axios.post(`${API_BASE}/games-esports/session/end`, { sessionId, score, metadata, fpsMetrics, actionLog }),

  getLeaderboard: (gameId, timeframe, limit) =>
    axios.get(`${API_BASE}/games-esports/leaderboard/${gameId}?timeframe=${timeframe}&limit=${limit}`),

  getPlayerStats: (gameId) =>

    axios.get(`${API_BASE}/mmr/${gameId}/find-opponent`),
};
```

### Socket.IO Client Setup

import io from 'socket.io-client';

const SOCKET_URL = 'https://p01--halo-api--6jbmvhzxwv4y.code.run';

export class SocketManager {
  private socket: any;

  connect(token: string) {
    this.socket = io(SOCKET_URL, {
      auth: { token },
      transports: ['websocket'],
    });

    this.socket.on('connect', () => console.log('Connected to game server'));
    this.socket.on('disconnect', () => console.log('Disconnected'));
  }

  joinMatchmaking(gameId: string) {
    this.socket.emit('matchmaking:join', { gameId });
  }

  onMatchFound(callback: (data: any) => void) {
