```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "type": "gift_sent",
  "amount": 500,
  "balanceBefore": 5000,
  "balanceAfter": 4500,
  "txId": "tx_abc123...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T04:30:00Z"
}
```

**Result:** Financial ledger is **audit-ready** with complete transaction integrity.

## 🛡️ 4. Fraud Controls ✅

### Webhook Security
- ✅ **Idempotency:** Duplicate webhooks blocked via `WebhookEvent` model
- ✅ **Replay Prevention:** Database unique constraint on `eventId`
- ✅ **HMAC Verification:** All webhooks verified before processing

**Test Result:** Attempted replay attack **BLOCKED** ✅

### Fraud Detection
- ✅ **Risk Scoring:** 0-100 multi-factor assessment
  - Factors: Amount, velocity, device, IP, history
  - Thresholds: Low (<30), Medium (30-49), High (50-69), Critical (70+)
  
- ✅ **Velocity Controls:**
  - Max 10 recharges/hour
  - Max 10,000 coins/day
  - Max 5 failures/hour

**Test Result:** Suspicious $50,000 payment flagged as **HIGH RISK** ✅

### Coin Injection Prevention
- ✅ **Service Layer Enforcement:** All operations go through `CoinLedgerService`
- ✅ **Fraud Service Integration:** Risk checks on every transaction
- ✅ **Application Layer Security:** Direct DB access monitored

**Test Result:** Fake coin injection attempt **LOGGED & BLOCKED** ✅

### Chargeback Handling
- ✅ **Detection:** Via webhook notification

- ✅ **Logging:** Fraud event created for review

**Test Result:** Simulated chargeback handled correctly with **full clawback** ✅

### Device Fingerprinting
- ✅ **Trust Scoring:** 0-100 based on device history
- ✅ **Tracking:** Device ID, IP history, user agent
- ✅ **Behavioral Analysis:** Flag suspicious patterns

**Result:** Multi-layered fraud defense is **production-grade**.
