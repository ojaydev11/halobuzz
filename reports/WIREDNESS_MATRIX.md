## Success Metrics

### **Current State**
- **Wired Components**: 25/40 (62.5%)
- **Partial Components**: 10/40 (25%)
- **Missing Components**: 5/40 (12.5%)

### **Target State (4 weeks)**
- **Wired Components**: 35/40 (87.5%)
- **Partial Components**: 5/40 (12.5%)
- **Missing Components**: 0/40 (0%)

## Conclusion

The HaloBuzz codebase demonstrates excellent architecture and comprehensive feature coverage. The main blockers are technical (build errors and missing services) rather than architectural, making them solvable with focused development effort.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with production deployment after 4 weeks of focused development to complete missing services and fix build issues.
