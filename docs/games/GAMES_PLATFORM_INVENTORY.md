# HaloBuzz Games Platform - Inventory & Gap Analysis

**Generated:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** Building Production-Grade Games Platform with 6 Real Games

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Building a complete games platform with 6 full-screen, polished games across 4 skill tiers (Noob/Casual/Core/Pro). Zero modals, zero text-button RNG, zero placeholders - only production-ready games with real graphics, physics, sound, and monetization.

**Current State:**
- Backend: Partial game infrastructure exists (Game model, routes, basic services)
- Mobile: Partial HaloClashScreen exists (modal-based, not full-screen)
- Missing: Complete games platform architecture, 6 production games, tournament system, telemetry

**Target State:**
- 6 complete games with full-screen UI, real physics, SFX, haptics
- Tournament system with leaderboards and prize pools
- Anti-fraud mechanisms and server-side validation
- Complete telemetry and analytics integration
- 60 FPS performance on mid-range devices

## EXISTING CODEBASE ANALYSIS

### Backend Infrastructure (✅ Good Foundation)

**Files Found:**
- `backend/src/models/Game.ts` - Game model with metadata, rules, rewards
- `backend/src/routes/games.ts` - Basic CRUD and play endpoint
- `backend/src/services/GamesEngineService.ts` - Deterministic round system
- `backend/src/services/GamingControlsService.ts` - Session limits
- `backend/src/services/ReputationService.ts` - Game win reputation

**Strengths:**
- Double-entry transaction system exists
- AI win rate enforcement (35-55%)
- Gaming controls with session limits
- Reputation system integration
- Deterministic rounds for fairness

**Gaps:**
- No tournament endpoints
- No session management endpoints
- No score submission with anti-cheat
- No leaderboard queries
- No game-specific config storage

### Mobile Infrastructure (⚠️ Needs Rebuild)

**Files Found:**
- `apps-halobuzz-mobile/src/screens/games/HaloClashScreen.tsx` - Draft/positioning/battle modal game
- Other game screens (RankedLobbyScreen, TournamentBrowserScreen, etc.) - Placeholders

**Strengths:**
- React Native setup working
- Expo with linear-gradient available
- Navigation structure exists

**Gaps:**
- No games platform structure
- No full-screen games (HaloClash is modal-based)
- No physics engines integrated
- No audio/haptics/particles
- No economy integration
- No performance monitoring

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS & DEFAULTS

To maintain builder-only mode, the following defaults are chosen:

### Tech Stack
- **3D Graphics:** react-three-fiber + drei for 3D games (Coin Flip, Buzz Arena)
- **2D Graphics:** react-native-skia for 2D FX (particles, trails)
- **Physics:** matter-js for 2D physics (StackStorm, Buzz Runner), use-cannon for 3D (Coin Flip)
- **Animation:** react-native-reanimated v3 with worklets
- **Audio:** expo-av for SFX and music
- **Haptics:** expo-haptics
- **Telemetry:** PostHog React Native SDK
- **Performance:** react-native-performance for FPS tracking

### Architecture Patterns
- **State Management:** Zustand for global game state, React hooks for local
- **API Client:** Axios with interceptors, token refresh
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO client for live tournaments
- **Asset Loading:** expo-asset with lazy loading
- **Error Handling:** Sentry React Native SDK

### Monetization Config
- **NOOB Tier:** 25-250 coins entry, 2x payout, 10% rake
- **CASUAL Tier:** 50-500 coins entry, 3x payout, 15% rake
- **CORE Tier:** 100-1000 coins entry, 5x payout, 20% rake
- **PRO Tier:** 500-5000 coins entry, 10x payout, 25% rake
- **Tournaments:** 10% of prize pool to platform, 90% distributed

### Performance Gates
- **Target:** 60 FPS, never <45 for 95th percentile
- **Memory:** <250MB per game session
- **TTI:** <1.5s after asset cache
- **Bundle Size:** Lazy load games, <50MB per game

6. Add SFX and music
7. Integrate telemetry (game_start, game_end, score, fps)
8. Write tests (unit, integration, Detox flow)
9. Document GDD with tuning parameters

### Phase 3: Parallel Game Development (Hours 4-8)
Build remaining 5 games in parallel using Coin Flip patterns:

2. Session management (start, update, validate)
3. Anti-fraud service (input validation, anomaly detection)
4. Score verification for top scores
5. Leaderboard queries (daily/weekly/monthly)

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Hours 10-12)
1. Unit tests for all business logic
2. Integration tests for API flows
3. Detox E2E tests for each game
4. Performance profiling (FPS, memory, TTI)
5. Optimize for 60 FPS target

### Phase 6: Documentation & Handover (Hours 12-14)
1. GDD per game
2. API Reference
3. Integration Guide
4. QA Runbook
5. Build artifacts and deployment commands

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Performance <60 FPS on mid-range devices | High | Profile early, optimize physics tick rates, use worklets |
| Bundle size too large (>50MB per game) | Medium | Lazy load games, compress assets, use SVG where possible |
| Physics instability (matter-js/use-cannon) | Medium | Tune physics parameters, cap max velocity, use deterministic seeds |
| Network latency for live tournaments | Medium | Optimistic UI updates, retry logic, offline mode |
| Asset creation time | Low | Use generated SVG, simple 3D primitives, royalty-free SFX |
| Anti-cheat bypass | Medium | Server-side validation, replay hashes, shadow bans |

---

## NEXT STEPS

Proceeding immediately to:
1. **Scaffold platform structure** (directories, dependencies)
2. **Build 3D Coin Flip Deluxe** as reference implementation
3. **Parallelize remaining 5 games**
4. **Backend expansion** (tournaments, sessions, anti-fraud)
5. **Testing and optimization**
6. **Documentation and handover**

**No placeholders, no waiting for approval - building production-ready games platform now.**
