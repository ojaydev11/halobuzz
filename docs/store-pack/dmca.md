2. **Identification of the material** that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (including URL, username, or other identifying information).

3. **Contact information** for the complaining party, including name, address, telephone number, and email address.

4. **A statement** that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
