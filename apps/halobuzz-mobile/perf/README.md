## Profiling Tools

### Development
```bash
# Metro bundle analysis
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android-release.bundle --sourcemap-output android-release.map
npx source-map-explorer android-release.bundle android-release.map

# Memory profiling
npx react-native run-android --variant=release
# Use Android Studio Profiler or Chrome DevTools

# Performance monitoring
npx flipper
```

### Production Monitoring
- **Cold Start**: Time from app launch to first interactive
- **FPS**: Frame drops during scrolling, navigation, animations
- **Memory**: Peak usage, GC pressure, memory leaks
- **CPU**: Main thread blocking, background processing
- **Network**: Request latency, payload size, connection reuse
- **Crashes**: ANRs, native crashes, JS errors

## Testing Performance Changes

### Before Making Changes
```bash
# Establish baseline
npm run perf:baseline
npm run test:performance
```

### After Each PR
```bash
# Measure impact
npm run perf:compare
npm run test:memory
npm run test:startup
```

### CI Performance Gates
```bash
# Automated in CI
npm run perf:budgets  # Fails build if budgets exceeded
npm run test:regression  # Compares against baseline
```

## Emergency Rollback

If performance budgets are exceeded:
1. Revert latest changes: `git revert HEAD~1`
2. Run regression tests: `npm run test:regression`
3. Measure recovery: `npm run perf:verify`
4. Deploy hotfix if critical

## Next Targets for PR-P3

1. **FlashList Implementation**: Replace FlatList with recycling virtualization
2. **Item prefetching**: Preload list items above/below viewport
3. **Skeleton screens**: Pre-computed layouts for instant list rendering
4. **Infinite scroll optimization**: Efficient data fetching and caching
